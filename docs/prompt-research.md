Do a deep dive research into the current best implementation methodologies for `Retrieval Augmented Generation`, particularly in the context of AI Agentic workflows to optimally implement context engineering best practices. Include in your comprehensive and practical report, top 20 open source projects for RAG implementation I can use/adapt. Your focus for the report is for real-world application of RAG rather than academic theories, make it like a practical handbook/guide for practical RAG implementation for AI Agent implementations.
