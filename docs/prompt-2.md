Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously plan and then create a detailed and comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` that correctly and accurately reflect the current codebase. The purpose of the PAD is to serve as a single-source-of-truth handbook to give a new developer or an AI coding agent a complete and accurate picture of the current codebase so that he/it can confidently handle any new PR. Add a project file hierarchy diagram with list of key files with description, also add mermaid diagrams to describe/depict the interaction between the user and the application and the interaction between application modules. Before creating the PAD, meticulously review the actual codebase files shared in the bundle set to validate your understanding and assumptions, then create an implementation plan for the PAD, include the document structure and checklist for the PAD in the plan. Review and validate the plan before meticulously follow the plan to create the complete PAD that correctly and accurately reflect the current codebase.
