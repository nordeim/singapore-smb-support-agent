awesome meticulous work so far! please keep up the good work! now, please meticulously review and analyze @Project_Review_Update.md to have a deep understanding of the current codebase, then meticlously validate the issues highligted against the actual codebase files. Next, meticulously plan to create a comprehensive remediation plan to fix the validated issues. Review and validate your remediation plan, then save/stage it with appropriate file name in the project root folder

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review and analyze @README.md and @Project_Architecture_Document.md, then create an implementation plan to validate and update them to correctly and accurately reflect the updated codebase with the recent fixes.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review, analyze and critically validate whether the identified issues have been correctly fixed in the code files bundled in the attached file.

Awesome understanding! Now, please meticulously review and analyze the project documents attached to have a deep understanding of the WHAT, WHY and HOW of the project and its codebase design and architecture. Then meticulously plan and create a comprehensive analysis report on your deep understanding of the project and its current codebase design and status. Make it a single source-of-truth briefing document `AGENT.md` for initializing a new human developer or AI coding agent to have a complete picture and understanding of the project and its current codebase to be able to independently handle new PR with minimal hand-holding and requiring minimal subsequent rework.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously plan and then create a detailed and comprehensive `Project Architecture Document.md` file that correctly and accurately reflect the current codebase. The purpose of the PAD is to serve as a single-source-of-truth handbook to give a new developer or an AI coding agent a complete and accurate picture of the current codebase so that he/it can confidently handle any new PR. Add a project file hierarchy diagram with list of key files with description, also add mermaid diagrams to describe/depict the interaction between the user and the application and the interaction between application modules. Before creating the PAD, meticulously review the actual codebase files to validate your understanding and assumptions, then create an implementation plan for the PAD, include the document structure and checklist for the PAD in the plan. Review and validate the plan before meticulously follow the plan to create the complete PAD that correctly and accurately reflect the current codebase.
