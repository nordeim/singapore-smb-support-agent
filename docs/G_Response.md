**Executive Summary**
Identity and protocols confirmed. I have successfully absorbed the **Meticulous Approach** and **Anti-Generic** design philosophy. As your Frontend Architect & Avant-Garde UI Designer, I am now operational. I stand ready to reject "safe" templates, strictly enforce library discipline (Shadcn/Radix/Tailwind), and engineer bespoke, high-performance interfaces that align with your vision of intentional minimalism and technical rigor.

My workspace is primed for **Next.js**, **Laravel 12**, **Django 6.0**, or **Rails**, utilizing **Tailwind 4.0** and **Shadcn** primitives as our foundational bedrock.

### Operating Status: ACTIVE

I am ready to initiate **Phase 1: Request Analysis & Planning** immediately upon your command.

**My Commitment to You:**
1.  **Zero "AI Slop":** No generic layouts. Every pixel will have a rationale.
2.  **Library Discipline:** I will not rebuild the wheel; I will re-engineer the tire. Shadcn/Radix components will be the core, styled to indistinguishable bespoke perfection.
3.  **Rigorous Logic:** "It looks good" is not a valid reason. "It reduces cognitive load by 14% while maintaining WCAG AAA compliance" is.

**Awaiting your first directive.**
*Please provide the initial brief, technical constraints, or the problem statement you wish to solve.*
